## What is DataDeps?
DataDeps is a package for simplifying the management of data in your julia application.
In particular it is designed to simplify the process of getting static data from some server into the local machine,
and making programs know where that data is.

For a few examples of its usefulness see [this blog post](http://white.ucc.asn.au/2018/01/18/DataDeps.jl-Repeatabled-Data-Setup-for-Repeatable-Science.html)

### Usage in Brief:
#### I want to use some data I have in my project. What do?
The short version is:

1. Stick your data anywhere with a open HTTP link. (Skip this if it is already online.)
2. Write a DataDep registration block.
3. Refer to the data using `datadep"Dataname/file.csv` etc as if it were a file path, and DataDeps.jl will sort out getting in onto your system.
4. For CI purposes set the `DATADEPS_ALWAY_ACCEPT` environment variable.

#### Where can I store my data online?
Where ever you want, so long as it gives an Open HTTP(/s) link to download it. ** 

 - I use an OwnCloud instance hosted by our national research infastructure.
 - Research data hosting like FigShare are a good idea.
 - You can just stick it on your website hosting if you are operating a website.
 - I'd like to hear if anyone has tested GoogleDrive or DropBox etc.


**(In theory other protocols and auth can be supported by using a different `fetch_method`)


### Why not store the data in Git?
Git is good for files that meet 3 requirements:

 - Plain text (not binary)
 - Smallish (Github will not accept files >50Mb in size)
 - Dynamic (Git is version control, it is good at knowing about changes)

There is certainly some room around the edges for this, like storing a few images in the repository is OK, but storing all of ImageNet is a no go. For those edge cases `ManualDataDep`s are good (see below).

DataDeps.jl is good for:

 - Any file format
 - Any size
 - Static (that is to say it doesn't change)

The main use case is downloading large datasets for machine learning, and corpora for NLP.
In this case the data is not even normally yours to begin with.
It lives on some website somewhere.
You don't want to copy and redistribute it;
and depending on liscensing you may not even be allowed to.

#### But my data is dynamic
Well how dynamic?
If you are willing to tag a new relase of your package each time the data changes, then maybe this is no worry, but maybe it is.

But the real question is, is DataDeps.jl really suitable for managing your data properly in the first place.
DataDeps.jl does not provide for versioning of data -- you can't force users to download new copies of your data using DataDeps.
There are work arounds, such as using DataDeps.jl + `deps/build.jl` to `rm(datadep"MyData", recursive=true, force=true` every package update. Or considering each version of the data as a different datadep with a different name.
DataDeps.jl may form part of your overall solution or it may not.
That is a discussion to have on [Slack](http://slackinvite.julialang.org/) or [Discourse](http://discourse.julialang.org/) (feel free to tag me, I am **@oxinabox** on both).
See also the list of related packages at the bottom

The other option is that if your data a good fit for git.
If it is in overlapping area of plaintext & small (or close enough to those things),
then you could add it as a `ManualDataDep` in and include it in the git repo in the  `deps/data/` folder of your package.
The ManuaulDataDep will not need manual installation if it is being installed via git.


## Usage for developers (including researchers)

### Examples
 - [the aformentioned blog post](http://white.ucc.asn.au/2018/01/18/DataDeps.jl-Repeatabled-Data-Setup-for-Repeatable-Science.html)
 - [Examples in the test code](test/examples.jl)
 - [Manual examples from the test code](test/examples_manual.jl)

### Installation
As normal for julia packages install DataDeps.jl using:

```
julia> Pkg.add("DataDeps")
```

Remember to add `DataDeps` to your `REQUIRE` file, so it will be automatically installed for end-users.

### Using a datadep string or `resolve` to get hold of the data.
For any registered DataDep (see below), `datadep"Name"`, returns a path to a folder containing the data.
If when that string macro is evaluated no such folder exists, then DataDeps will swing into action and coordinate the acquisition of the data into a folder, then return the path that now contains the data.

You can also use `datadep"Name/subfolder/file.txt"` (and similar) to get a path to the file at  `subfolder/file.txt` within the data directory for `Name`.
Just like when using the plain `datadep"Name"` this will if required downloadload the whole datadep (**not** just the file).
However, it will also engage additional features to verify that that file exists (and is readable),
and if not will attempt to help the user resolve the situation.
This is useful if files may have been deleted by mistake, or if a ManualDataDep might have been incorrectly installed.


#### Installing Data Lazily
Most packages using more than one data source, will want to download them only when the user requires them.
That is to say if the user never calls a function that requires that data, then the data should not be downloaded.

DataDeps.jl resolves the dependency when a `datadep"Name"` string is evaluated.
If no code containing a data dependency string is run, then no data will be downloaded

The basic way is to hide the datadep in some code not being evaluated except on a condition.
For example, say some webcam security system can be run in training mode, in which case data should be used from the datadep,
or in deployment mode, in which case the data should be read from the webcam's folder:

```
data_folder = training_mode ? datadep"SecurityFootage" : "/srv/webcam/today"       
```
The data will not be downloaded if `training_mode==false`, because the referred to folder is never required.
Of-course if the data was already downloaded, then it wouldn't be downloaded again either way.

Another example of a particularly nice way of doing this is to use the datadep string as the default value for a function paramater
`function predict(path=datadep"SecurityFootage")`.
If the user passses a value when they call `predict` then the datadep string will never be evaluated.
So the data will not be sourced via DataDeps.jl


#### Installing Data Eagerly
If you want the data to be installed when the package is first loaded,
just put the datadep string `datadep"Name"` anywhere it will immediately run.
For example, in the `__init__` function immediately after the registration block.

If you want it to be installed at `Pkg.build` time.
The best thing to do is to put your data dep registration block in a file (eg `src/dataregistrations.jl`),
and then `include` it into `deps/build.jl` followed by putting in the datadep string somewhere at global scope.
(Including would be done by `include(pathjoin(@__DIR__,"..","src","dataregistrations.jl"`).
One would also `include` that registrations file into the `__init__` function in the  main source of the package as well.





### Registering a DataDep
A DataDeps registration is a block of code declaring a dependency.
You should put it somewhere that it will be executed before any other code in your script that depends on that data.
In most cases it is best to put it inside the  [modules's `__init__()` function](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/modules/#Module-initialization-and-precompilation-1).


To do the actual registration one just  calls `register(::AbstractDataDep)`.
The rest of this section is basically about the constructors for the `DataDep` type.
It is pretty flexible. See the [examples](#examples).

The basic Registration block looks like: (Type parameters are shown below are a simplifaction)
```
register(DataDep(
    name::String,
    message::String,
    remote_path::Union{String,Vector{String}...},
    [checksum::Union{String,Vector{String}...},]; # Optional, if not provided will generate
    # keyword args (Optional):
    fetch_method=http_download # (remote_filepath, local_directory_path)->local_filepath
    post_fetch_method=identity # (local_filepath)->Any
))
```

#### Required Fields

 - *Name**: the name used to refer to this datadep, coresponds to a folder name where it will be stored
    - It can have spaces or any other character that is allowed in a Windows filestring (which is a strict subset of the restriction for unix filenames).
 - *Message*: A message displayed to the user for they are asked if they want to downloaded it.
    - This is normally used to give a link to the original source of the data, a paper to be cited etc.
 - *remote_path*: where to fetch the data from. Normally a string or strings) containing an URL
    - This is usually a string, or a vector of strings (or a vector of vector... see [Recursive Structure](Recursive Structure) below)

#### Optional Fields
 - *checksum* this is very flexible, it is used to check the files downloaded correctly
    - By far the most common use is to just provide a SHA256 sum as a hex-string for the files
    - If not provided, then a warning message with the  SHA256 sum is displayed. This is to help package devs workout the sum for there files, without using an external tool.
    - If you want to use a different hashing algorithm, then you can provide a tuple `(hashfun, targethex)`
        - `hashfun` should be a function which takes an IOStream, and returns a `Vector{UInt8}`.
	      - Such as any of the functions from [SHA.jl](https://github.com/staticfloat/SHA.jl), eg `sha3_384`, `sha1_512`
	      - or `md5` from [MD5.jl](https://github.com/oxinabox/MD5.jl)
  - If you want to use a different hashing algorithm, but don't know the sum, you can provide just the `hashfun` and a warning message will be displayed, giving the correct tuple of `(hashfun, targethex)` that should be added to the registration block.

	- If you don't want to provide a checksum,  because your data can change pass in the type `Any` which will suppress the warning messages. (But see above warnings about "what if my data is dynamic")
    - Can take a vector of checksums, being one for each file, or a single checksum in which case the per file hashes are `xor`ed to get the target hash. (See [Recursive Structure](Recursive Structure) below)


 -  `fetch_method=http_download` a function to run to download the files.
    - Function should take 2 parameters `(remote_filepath, local_directorypath)`, and can must return the local filepath to the file downloaded
    - Can take a vector of methods, being one for each file, or a single method, in which case that method is used to download all of them. (See [Recursive Structure](Recursive Structure) below)
	- Overloading this lets you change things about how the download is done -- the transport protocol.
	- The default is suitable for HTTP[/S], without auth. Modifying it can add authentication or an entirely different protocol (e.g. git, google drive etc)
	- This function is also responsible for workout out what the local file should be called (as this is protocol dependent)
	
	
 - `post_fetch_method` a function to run after the files have download
    - Should take the local filepath as its first and only argument. Can return anything.
    - Default is to do nothing.
    - Can do what it wants from there, but most likes wants to extract the file into the data directory.
    - towards this end DataDeps includes a command: `unpack` which will extract an compressed folder, deleting the original.
    - It should be noted that it `post_fetch_method` runs from within the data directory
       - which means operations that just write to the current working directory (like `rm` or `mv` or ```run(`SOMECMD`))``` just work.
       - You can call `cwd()` to get the the data directory for your own functions. (Or `dirname(local_filepath)`)
    - Can take a vector of methods, being one for each file, or a single method, in which case that ame method is applied to all of the files. (See [Recursive Structure](Recursive Structure) below)


#### Recursive Structure
`fetch_method`, `post_fetch_method` and `checksum` all can match the structure of `remote_path`.
If `remote_path` is just an single path, then they each must be single items.
If `remote_path` is a vector, then if those properties are a vector (which must be the same length) then they are applied each to the corresponding element; or if not then it is applied to all of them.
This means you can for example provide check-sums per file, or per-the-all.
It also means you can specify different `post_fetch_methods` for different files, e.g. doing nothing to some, and extracting others.
Further more this applies recursively.

For example:
```
register(DataDep("eg", "eg message",
    ["http//example.com/text.txt", "http//example.com/sub1.zip", "http//example.com/sub2.zip"]
    post_fetch_method = [identity, file->run(`unzip $file`), file->run(`unzip $file`)]
))
```
So `identity`  (i.e. nothing) will be done to the first paths resulting file, and the second and third will be unzipped.

can also be written:
```
register(DataDep("eg", "eg message",
    ["http//example.com/text.txt", ["http//example.com/sub1.zip", "http//example.com/sub2.zip"]]
    post_fetch_method = [identity, file->run(`unzip $file`)]
))
```
The unzip will be applied to both elements in the child array



#### ManualDataDep
ManualDataDeps are datadeps that have to be managed by some means outside of DataDeps.jl,
but DataDeps.jl will still provide the convient `datadep"MyData"` string macro for finding them.
As mentions above, if you put the data in your git repo for your package under `deps/data/NAME` then it will be managed by julia package manager.

A manual DataDep registration is just like a normal `DataDep` registration,
except that only a `name` and `message` are provided.
Inside the message you should give instructions on how to acquire the data.
Again see the [examples](#examples)



### DataDepsGenerators
[DataDepsGenerators.jl](https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDepsGenerators.jl) is a julia package to help generate DataDeps registration blocks from well-known data sources.
It attempts to use webscraping and such to workout what should be in the registration block.
You can then edit the generated code to make it suitable for your use.
(E.g. remove excessive information in the message)


### Assuming direct control and customization
The hierachy of methods for acquiring a datadep is:

`datadep"name/path"` ▶ `resolve("name/path", @__FILE__)` ▶ `resolve(::AbstractDataDep, "path", @__FILE__)` ▶ `download(::DataDep)`

One can make use of this at various levels to override the default generally sane behavior.
Most of the time you shouldn't have to -- the normal point of customization is in setting the `post_fetch_method`, and occasionally `fetch_method` or  `hash=(hashmethod, key)`.

#### Advanced: `resolve` for high-level programmatic resolution
`resolve("name/path", @__FILE__)` is the functional form of `datadep"name/path`.
If you are really worried about resolving a datadep early, or of you are generating the names pragmatically, or you just really feel uncomfortable about string macros, you can use `resolve(namepath, @__FILE__)`.
You can (basically) equivalently use `@datadep_str namepath`.
Passing in the `@__FILE__` is important as it allows access to the package's "private" data deps location (`PKGNAME/deps/data`),
which may be needed incase of datadep name conflicts; or for `ManualDataDep`s that are included in the repo.
You could passing something else to bypass this "privacy".


It comes in a number of flavors for which you can read the docstring `?resolve`.
Including `resolve(::AbstactDataDep, innerpath, @__FILE__)`, which can directly download a datadep.



#### `download` for low-level programmatic resolution.
For more hardcore devs customising the user experience,
and people needing to do debugging you may assume (nearly) full control over the download operation
by directly invoking the method `Base.download(::DataDep, localpath; kwargs...)`.
It is fully documented in its docstring.




## Usage for end-users
The main goal of DataDeps.jl is to simplify life for the user.
They should just forget about the data their package needs.

### Moving Data
Moving data is a great idea.
DataDeps.jl is in favour of moving data
When data is automatically downloaded it will almost always go to the same location.
The first (existant, writable) directory on your `DATADEPS_LOADPATH`.
Which by-default is `~/.julia/datadeps/`.
(If you delete this, it will go to another location
But you can move them from there to anywhere in the `DATADEPS_LOADPATH`. (See below)

If you have a large chunk of data that everyone in your lab is using (e.g. a 1TB video corpora),
you probably want to shift it to a shared area, like `/usr/share/datadeps`.
Even if you don't have write permissions, you can have a sysadmin move it, and so long as you still have read permission DataDeps.jl will find it and use it for you.


## The Load Path
The Load Path is the list of paths that DataDeps.jl looks in when trying to resolve a data dependency.
If it doesn't find the data in any of them it will download the data.

It has 3 sources:
 - the package load path:
     - determined from the package where the `datadep"NAME"` was used
 - The user defined load path
     - determined from the contents of the environment variable `DATADEPS_LOAD_PATH`
     - this can be a colon separated list (Like most unix path variables)
 - the standard load path
     - depends on your system and configuration
     - normally starts with user specific locations like your home directory, and expands out to shared locations
     - See below lists of examples
     - This can be disabled by setting the `DATADEPS_NO_STANDARD_LOAD_PATH` environment variable.

In general it should by default include just about anywhere you might want to put the data.
If it doesn't, please file an issue. (Unless your location is super-specific, e.g. `/MyUniName/student/commons/datadeps`).
As mentioned you can add things to the load path by setting the environment variable `DATADEPS_LOAD_PATH`.
You can also make symlinks from the locations on the loadpath to other locations where the data really is, if you'ld rather do that.

When **loading data** the load path is searched in order for a readable folder of the right now.
When **saving data** is it is searched in order, skipping the package load path, for a writable directory.
Simple way to avoid part of the standard loadpath being used for saving is to delete it, or make it unwritable.
You can (and should when desired) move things around between any folder in the load path without redownloading.


### Unix Standard Load Path
For the user **oxinabox**

```bash
/home/wheel/oxinabox/.julia/datadeps
/home/wheel/oxinabox/datadeps
/scratch/datadeps
/staging/datadeps
/usr/share/datadeps
/usr/local/share/datadeps
```

### Windows Standard Load Path
For the user **oxinabox**, when using JuliaPro 0.6.2.1, on windows 7.
(Other configurations should be fairly similar).

```batch
C:\Users\oxinabox\AppData\Local\JuliaPro-0.6.2.1\pkgs-0.6.2.1\datadeps
C:\Users\oxinabox\datadeps
C:\Users\oxinabox\AppData\Roaming\datadeps
C:\Users\oxinabox\AppData\Local\datadeps
C:\ProgramData\datadeps
C:\Users\Public\datadeps
```


### Having multiple copies of the same DataDir
You probably don't want to have multiple copies of a DataDir with the same name.
DataDeps.jl will try to handle it as gracefuly as it can.
But having different DataDep under the same name, is probably going to lead to packages loading the wrong one.
Except if they are (both) located in their packages `deps/data` folder.

By moving a package's data dependency into its package directory under `deps/data`, it becomes invisible except to that package.
For example `~/.julia/v0.6/EXAMPLEPKG/deps/data/EXAMPLEDATADEP/`,
for the package `EXAMPLEPKG`, and the datadep `EXAMPLEDATADEP`.

Ideally though you should probably raise an issue with the package maintainers and see if one (or both) of them want to change the DataDep name.

Note also when it comes to file level loading, e.g. `datadep"Name/subfolder/file.txt"`,
DataDeps does not check all folders with that `Name` (if you have multiples).
If the file is not in the first folder it finds you will be presented with the recovery dialog,
from which the easiest option is to select to delete the folder and retry,
since that will result in it checking the second folder (as the first one does not exist).


## Configuration
Currently configuration is done via Enviroment Variables.
It is likely to stay that way, as they are also easy to setup in CI tools.
You can set these in the `.juliarc` file using the `ENV` dictionary if you don't want to mess up your `.profile`.
However, most people shouldn't need to.
DataDeps.jl tries to have very sensible defaults.

 - `DATADEPS_ALWAY_ACCEPT` -- bypasses the confirmation before downloading data. Set to `true` (or similar string)
    - This is provided for scripting (in particular CI) use
    - Note that it remains your responsibility to understand and read any terms of the data use (this is remains true even if you don't turn on this bypass)
	- default `false`
 - `DATADEPS_LOAD_PATH` -- The list of paths to be prepended to the standard loadpath to save and load data from
    - By default this is empty, but it can be a colon separated list (like most unix path variables). [For more details see above](#The-Load-Path)
 - `DATADEPS_NO_STANDARD_LOAD_PATH` if this is set to `true` (default `false`), then the aforementioned list of standard loadpath files is not included
 - `DATADEPS_DISABLE_DOWNLOAD` -- causes any action that would result in the download being triggered to throw an exception.
   - useful e.g. if you are in an environment with metered data, where your datasets should have already been downloaded earlier, and if there were not you want to respond to the situation rather than let DataDeps download them for you.
   - default `false`

## Extending DataDeps.jl for Contributors
Feel free (encouraged even) to open issues and make PRs.

### Internal Docstrings
As well as the usual all the publicly facing methods having docistrings,
most of the internal methods do also.
You can view them in the source; or via the julia REPL etc.
Hopefully the internal docstrings make it clear how each method is used.

### Creating custom `AbstractDataDep` types
The primary point of extension for DataDeps.jl is in developers defining their own DataDep types.
99% of developers won't need to do this, a `ManualDataDep` or a normal (automatic) `DataDep` covers most use cases.
However, if for example you want to have a DataDep that after the download is complete and after the `post_fetch_method` is run, does an additional validation, or some data synthesis step that requires working with multiple of the files simultaneously (which `post_fetch_method` can not do), or a `SemiManualDataDep` where the user does some things and then other things happen automatically, then this can be done by creating your own `AbstractDataDep` type.

The code for `ManualDataDep` is a good place to start looking to see how that is done.
You can also encapsulate an `DataDep` as one of the elements of your new type.

If you do this you might like to contribute the type back up to this repository, so others can use it also.
Particularly, if it is something that generalises beyond your specific usecase.

### Other similar packages:
DataDeps.jl isn't the answer to all your download needs.
It is focused squarely on static data.
It might not be good for your use case.

Alternatives that I am aware of are:

 - [RemoteFiles.jl](https://github.com/helgee/RemoteFiles.jl): keeps local files up to date with remotes
 - [BinaryProvider.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryProvider.jl) downloads binaries intended as part of a build chain. I'm pretty sure you can trick it into downloading data.
 - [`Base.download`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/stdlib/file/#Base.download) if your situtation is really simple just sticking a `download` into the `deps/build.jl` file might do you just fine.

 Outside of julia's ecosystem is

  - [Python: Quilt](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt). Quilt uses a centralised data store, and allows the user to download the data as Python packages containing it in serialised from. It *might* be possible to use PyCall.jl to use this from julia.
  - [R: suppdata](https://github.com/ropensci/suppdata), features extra stuff relating to published datasets (See also DataDepsGenerators.jl), it *might* be possible to use RCall.jl to use this from julia.
  - [Node/Commandline: Datproject](https://datproject.org/) I'm not too familiar with this, it is a bit of an ecosystem of its own. I think using it from the commandline might satisfy many people's needs. Or automating it with shell calls in `build.jl`.
